Work on linuxinfo was done primarily by:

	Alex Buell, alex.buell@munted.org.uk

Significant code, ideas, or porting help have been contributed by:

	Johnny Tevessen, j.tevessen@gmx.de (contributed the autoconf stuff - COOL!)
	Stany, stany@zerkalo.istar.net (alerted me to the existence of a commercial package)
	Vince Weaver, weaver@eng.umd.edu (parts of code was taken from linux_logo 2.10)
