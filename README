This is linuxinfo, used on Linux platforms.

The latest releases are always available at:

        http://www.helgefjell.de/linuxinfoitem.php?name=download

Previously version were available at

(Note that this domain is no longer active).

linuxinfo was initially written by Alex Buell, alex.buell@munted.org.uk.
Maintainership was transferred to Helge Kreutzmann <debian@helgefjell.de>
in 2014 who integrated the patches that had been accumulated in the Debian
versions of linuxinfo.

See the CREDITS file for a list of folks who have helped us out. linuxinfo
is copyrighted under the terms of the GPL 2+ and LGPL 2 (See the COPYING file for
the details).[1]
 
To build, simply use:

	./configure 
	make

Once it's finished the make process, su to root (if not already root), and
use:

	make install

to install the linuxinfo binary and man page to the appropriate
directories. Default is for the binary to go into /usr/local/bin and for
the man page to go into /usr/local/man/man1. You can change this by using
the --prefix in ./configure if required.

Linuxinfo contains localized versions of the man page.

On X86(_64) linuxinfo can be built with regular expression support. 
This will recognize more systems but take more (binary) space.
Use --with-pcre to enable.

If linuxinfo does not recognize your CPU, please send me a copy of your 
/proc/cpuinfo file, and I shall fix it for next version. Thanks. 

NOTE! linuxinfo has no capability to detect the clock speed on kernels
older than 2.1.x, *or* on low end processors.
