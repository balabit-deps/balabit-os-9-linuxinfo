linuxinfo (3.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Linuxinfo now uses regular expressions in x86(-64). Thus it should detect
    vastly more machines than previously.

    If your machine is not detected (i.e. "Unknown" is shown) please report it
    (preferably using reportbug(1)) so that I can add it.
